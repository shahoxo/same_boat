# SameBoat
Sameboat is monitoring forgetting to add something to environment variables (or some files).

For example, add `AWESOME_VALUE=true` to .env.development during development.

It is at deploy time that you notice that you forgot to add it to .env.preview

SameBoat supports to check it in advance.

The procedure is as follows
1. Create the latest file stamp of the .env group
2. Update a part of .env group
3. Check if the file stamp of the .env group is latest

SameBoat hope 3 will be done at your CI.

The command option is somewhat special.

glossary | option name
--- | ---
files | `-c --crews`
file stamp | `-j --journal`

Because they are in the same boat.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'same_boat'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install same_boat

## Usage

```ruby
# Rakefile
require 'same_boat/tasks'
```

### update journal to latest
`$ rake same_boat:journal` 

### be in the same boat 
`$ rake same_boat:row`

### specify crews or journal
```
$ rake same_boat:journal -c path/to/.env* -j path/to/.some.journal
$ rake same_boat:row -c path/to/.env* -j path/to/.some.journal

```
